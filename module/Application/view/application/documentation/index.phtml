					<h2>What is Apigility?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Creating APIs for your applications shouldn't be hard.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Apigility is an API Builder, designed to simplify creating
                        and maintaining useful, easy to consume, and well
                        structured APIs. Regardless of your experience in API
                        building, with Apigility you can build APIs that enable
                        mobile apps, developer communities, and any other consumer
                        controlled access to your applications.
                    </p>

					<h2>Apigility and Zend Framework 2</h2>

                    <p>
                        Apigility can be used to implement APIs in 
                        <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>. We developed Apigility
                        using <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework 2</a>,
                        but this doesn't mean you have to use this framework to develop
                        your API. You can use Apigility in any PHP application, using
                        all the libraries and frameworks that you want.
                    </p>

					<h2>System Requirements</h2>

                    <p>
                        To run Apigility you need PHP 5.3.23 or greater. We 
                        recommend PHP 5.4.8+ for serving the admin user interface.
                    </p>
