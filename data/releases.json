We've made enormous headway at this point, but we'll let **you** be\r\nthe judge of that; [visit the documentation yourself](http://apigility.org/documentation)!\r\n\r\nAmong topics covered:\r\n\r\n- A \"Getting Started\" guide, and a companion, \"REST Service Tutorial\".\r\n- An API Primer\r\n- Chapters on Authentication/Authorization, Content Validation, and the\r\n  Documentation features.\r\n- A module-by-module reference guide, detailing configuration options.\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWhile the beta cycle is primarily around stabilizing the API and Admin UI, we\r\ndecided one new feature warranted inclusion in version 1: a packaging/deployment\r\ntool, [zf-deploy](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy).\r\n\r\nThis tool allows you to create packages from your Apigility -- or any ZF2\r\napplication -- for deployment. Formats supported include zip, tar, tgz, and zpk\r\n(the Zend Server deployment package format). We plan to integrate support for\r\ndeploying zpk packages soon as well.\r\n\r\nBeta2 Updates\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nPolishing, polishing, polishing was our mantra for beta2. This included\r\nincorporating user feedback, but also scrutinizing the UI and code for\r\nconsistency issues.\r\n\r\n### UI Updates\r\n\r\nFollowing beta1, we had a number of complaints about UI responsiveness,\r\nparticularly around the \"Fields\" screen. We did some analysis of the UI, and a\r\nlot of work around dynamically loading and unloading DOM in the admin based on\r\nwhat should be visible. As a result, we were able to significantly improve\r\nresponsiveness. There may be more work to do, but early reports indicate that\r\nthe changes make the Admin UI usable in situations that previously crashed the\r\nbrowser.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the performance improvements, we made the following updates:\r\n\r\n- On the \"Authorizations\" screen for each API, if no authentication is currently\r\n  configured, we display a message to this effect, and link to the\r\n  authentication screen. Unfortunately, in beta1, that link was invalid; we've\r\n  fixed this.\r\n\r\n- The \"Fields\" tab received a slight overhaul. We noticed that items with\r\n  toggles displayed \"Yes/No\" terminology, but \"On/Off\" for the actual form\r\n  input; these now use \"Yes/No\" verbiage consistently. The \"Help\" screen could\r\n  not be dismissed with the `<Esc>` key; it now can. Previously, when hitting\r\n  `<Enter>` from the \"Create New Field\" text input, it would raise the \"Help\"\r\n  screen; it now properly creates the new field. The \"Description\" field was\r\n  moved to the first option displayed for each field, to promote documentation\r\n  of fields. We also added a \"Validation Failure Message\" field to allow\r\n  specifying a unified error message on failed validation (vs. one or more per\r\n  validator); we also ensured that \"blanking\" out the data in this field will\r\n  remove any such message previously set. Finally, filters are now listed before\r\n  validators, to signal the order in which validation operations occur\r\n  (filtering/normalization occurs before validation).\r\n\r\n- The \"Source Code\" tab was not properly generating links for files; we've fixed\r\n  this in beta2.\r\n\r\n### Engine Updates\r\n\r\nA few improvements were made to the API engine itself:\r\n\r\n- The `UnauthorizedListener` registered by the `zf-apigility` module was not\r\n  registering headers set by the `zf-mvc-auth` module, meaning that the\r\n  `WWW-Authenticate` header was not propagating. This has been corrected.\r\n\r\n- We modified `ZF\\ContentNegotiation\\JsonModel` to check for `json_encode()`\r\n  errors, and to raise an exception when one is detected. This prevents\r\n  situations where an empty response is returned on inability to serialize to\r\n  JSON.\r\n\r\n- `zf-apigility-documentation-swagger` was not returning a `Content-Type` header\r\n  value of `application/vnd.swagger+json`; it now does.\r\n\r\n- We fixed the bcrypt cost in `zf-oauth2` to use the defaults from `Zend\\Crypt`.\r\n\r\n- We updated the OAuth2 database schema in `zf-oauth2` to match that of the\r\n  upstream [oauth2-server-php package](https://github.com/bshaffer/oauth2-server-php).\r\n\r\n- We now inject the `ZF\\Rest\\ResourceEvent` with the current MVC request object;\r\n  you can retrieve it from within your resource class using\r\n  `$this->getEvent()->getRequest()`. This will give you access to HTTP request\r\n  headers, query string arguments, etc.\r\n\r\n- We no longer allow multiple \"self\" relational links in `zf-hal`.\r\n\r\n- When specifying route parameters for a `zf-hal` metadata map, you can now use\r\n  a PHP callable as the value; `zf-hal` will invoke that callable with the\r\n  object for which a link is being generated in order to get the value for that\r\n  route parameter. This is particularly useful for deterimining identifiers for\r\n  parent resources.\r\n\r\n- We moved the `zf-apiglity-welcome` requirement to be a development-only\r\n  requirement.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/238660","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/238660/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/238660/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/1.0.0beta1","id":238660,"tag_name":"1.0.0beta1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Apigility Version 1.0.0beta","draft":false,"author":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2014-03-21T21:17:17Z","published_at":"2014-03-24T20:33:32Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/100061","id":100061,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta1.tgz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-compressed","state":"uploaded","size":19103345,"download_count":177,"created_at":"2014-03-24T20:44:24Z","updated_at":"2014-03-24T20:44:54Z"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/100104","id":100104,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta1.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":22706007,"download_count":21315,"created_at":"2014-03-24T20:45:40Z","updated_at":"2014-03-24T20:46:14Z"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/tarball/1.0.0beta1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/zipball/1.0.0beta1","body":"This is the first beta release for Apigility. From this point forward, we will\nbe keeping backwards compatibility between versions. New features will be\ntargetted for version 1.1.0, with bugfixes and security fixes targetted for the\nupcoming stable release and any subsequent maintenance releases.\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\nAll Apigility modules were updated to use a [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/psr-4-autoloader/psr-4-autoloader.md)\nstructure and autoloader. This flattens the packages significantly, and also\nallows simplification of the PHPUnit test runner. A PSR-4 variant of the ZF2\n`StandardAutoloader`, `ZF\\Apigility\\Autoloader`, was created to provide true\nPSR-4 autoloading, including the ability to have underscores (`_`) in class\nnames, which has been a common feature request. ZF2 `Module` classes created for\nnew API modules now use the new autoloader for loading classes inside the\nmodule.\n\nAll modules were added to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), giving us continuous integration going\nforward.\n\nWith the release of Zend Framework 2.3.0, we were able to update the ZF2\ndependency to remove the `-dev` stability marker; this also means that packages\nshould start to be smaller, as we'll be able to use distribution versions of ZF2\ngoing forward instead of git clones.\n\nAdditionally, the following features were added:\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-content-validation#8](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-content-validation/issues/8) adds the ability to provide HTTP method-specific input\n  filters. This feature is not yet integrated into the Apigility Admin UI, but\n  can be configured manually. To do so, add method/input filter service name\n  pairs for the given controller service name; if no method-specific input\n  filter exists, zf-content-validation will fallback to the `input_filter` key,\n  if defined. As an example:\n\n    'zf-content-validation' => array(\n        'Example\\V1\\Rest\\Status\\Controller' => array(\n            // This is the fallback input filter, and the one the UI\n            // can define and manipulate:\n            'input_filter' => 'Example\\V1\\Rest\\Status\\Validator',\n            // This one will be used on POST requests only:\n            'POST' => 'Example\\V1\\Rest\\Status\\NewStatusValidator',\n        ),\n    ),\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-mvc-auth#20](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-mvc-auth/issues/20)\n  provides a patch that injects the `MvcEvent` with a new key,\n  `ZF\\MvcAuth\\Identity`. You can pull the discovered identity from this event\n  parameter now. Additionally, in REST resources, calling `$this->getIdentity()`\n  will retrieve the identity.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#124](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/124) and\n  [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#129](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/129)\n  provide initial input filters for all Apigility Admin API services, as well as\n  UI integration for reporting errors. All validation errors are caught and\n  reported in a single dialog within the form that raises them.\n\n- The 'edit settings' screen for REST services now allows editing the entity\n  class and collection class names.\n\n- The 'API Overview' page now links services to their overviews. The service\n  description is displayed beneath each service; if not yet defined, a link to\n  the 'edit documentation' tab for the service is provided.\n\n- A new modal will be displayed to users of the Apigility Admin UI if the API\n  detects that the filesystem is not writable. The modal details what changes\n  need to be made in order for the UI and API to work correctly.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-oauth2#30](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-oauth2/issue/30) splits\n  out initialization of the `oauth2-server-php` server from the `zf-oauth2`\n  controller, allowing the ability to replace it, write a delegator for it, etc.\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-content-validation#10](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-content-validation/issues/10)\n  changes the key used by the `InputFilterAbstractServiceFactory` from\n  `input_filters` to `input_filter_specs`. This is due to the fact that ZF 2.3.0\n  introduces an `InputFilterManager`, which is already consuming the key\n  `input_filters`. Wrapped in this change is the fact that the\n  `InputFilterAbstractServiceFactory` is now registered as an abstract service\n  factory with the `InputFilterManager`, instead of with the application service\n  manager instance.\n\n  For those updating their Apigility libraries to 1.0.0beta1, edit your\n  `module.config.php` files to rename the `input_filters` key to\n  `input_filter_specs`.\n\n- The `zf-configuration` controller `ZF\\Configuration\\Controller` was moved into\n  `zf-apigility-admin`. This URI for the service remains the same, but the\n  controller itself has moved. (This change was done to consolidate all Admin\n  API controllers in the same module, as well as to reduce the dependencies\n  needed in the `zf-configuration` component.)\n\nFixes\n-----\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#115](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/115) - Ensures\n  that non-SQLite PDO OAuth2 adapters may be provided without error.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#117](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/117) - Ensure\n  that the `route_match` is passed to the API when saving an RPC service.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#118](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/118) - Ensure\n  that the Content Negotiation `selector` is passed to the API correctly when\n  saving an RPC service.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#120](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/120) - Remove\n  duplicate call to initialize the `ServerUrl` helper.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#122](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/122) and\n  [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#123](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/123) - Add checks\n  for array keys before accessing them when building the documentation graph for\n  a given service operation.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#126](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/126) - Updates \n  the admin to pass the `X-UA-Compatible` meta tag in order to provide Internet\n  Explorer compatibility.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#132](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/132) - Ensures\n  that authorization data is fetched each time a new service is created, a\n  service is updated, or a service is deleted, ensuring the table reflects the\n  current list of available services and HTTP methods.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#133](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/133) - Updates\n  the 'angular-flash' functionality to anchor flash messages to the bottom of\n  the window. Additionally, any error flash messages now have a 'close' button,\n  requiring user intervention for dismissal.\n\n- Many fixes were made to the UI to improve performance, remove UI refresh\n  errors, provide more consistent color schemes, ensure tabs stay focussed\n  between state transitions, etc.\n\n- The Apigility Admin API was updated to break the authentication service into\n  more granular sub-services, one for each type of authentication supported.\n  This simplifies validation, and allows for future expansion.\n\n- Work was done to ensure opcode cache detection is as solid as possible. We now\n  properly distinguish between APC and APCu, allowing the latter to be enabled\n  when using the Admin API.\n\n- `zf-apigility-documentation` was not correctly aggregating RPC documentation;\n  this has been fixed.\n\n- We reviewed the various events triggered to ensure that they were happening in\n  the correct order, which we defined as:\n\n  - Authentication\n  - HTTP method negotiation (is the method called allowed for the service?)\n  - Authorization (is the discovered identity allowed to perform the requested\n    action?)\n  - Content Negotiation (determine incoming Content-Type and marshal data from\n    request body; determine if Accept and/or Content-Type are valid for the\n    request)\n  - Content Validation\n\n  Several event listener priorities were updated to fit the above requirements.\n  A new listener, `ZF\\Rest\\Listener\\OptionsListener`, was introduced to handle\n  HTTP method negotiation for REST services, and is registered at the same\n  priority as the RPC `OptionsListener` (which previously existed).\n\n- `zf-configuration` was updated to never write configuration using short-array\n  notation; this was done to ensure compatibility of generated configuration\n  with PHP 5.3 (as developers may use the admin API via 5.4, but deploy to 5.3)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/205737","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/205737/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/205737/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/0.9.1","id":205737,"tag_name":"0.9.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Apigility Version 0.9.1","draft":false,"author":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2014-03-01T17:57:53Z","published_at":"2014-03-01T18:20:42Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/84527","id":84527,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.9.1.tgz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-compressed-tar","state":"uploaded","size":115645142,"download_count":87,"created_at":"2014-03-01T18:13:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-01T18:20:42Z"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/84528","id":84528,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.9.1.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":121077265,"download_count":987,"created_at":"2014-03-01T18:13:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-01T18:20:42Z"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/tarball/0.9.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/zipball/0.9.1","body":"Fixes two critical issues in authentication/authorization reported against\r\n0.9.0:\r\n\r\n- [zfcampus/zfoauth2#27](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-oauth2/issues/27)\r\n  reported an inability to save OAuth2 adapter details from the Apigility admin\r\n  UI.

We still recommend **5.4.8** for serving the admin user interface.\r\n\r\n- New modules, [zf-apigility-documentation](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation) and\r\n  [zf-apigility-documentation-swagger](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation-swagger),\r\n  providing documentation visualizations of APIs created with Apigility. The\r\n  base module provides both JSON and HTML visualizations via the URI\r\n  `/apigility/documentation`, based on the Accept header value present.\r\n  zf-apigility-documentation-swagger provides an additional JSON visualization\r\n  for the mediatype `application/vnd.swagger+json`, for seeding a [Swagger\r\n  UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) installation; additionally, it\r\n  provides the Swagger UI via `/apigility/swagger`.\r\n\r\n  zf-apigility-documentation is enabled by default in zf-apigility-skeleton;\r\n  zf-apigility-documentation-swagger is an opt-in module.\r\n\r\n- **The `/admin` and `/welcome` routes are now removed!** The admin UI now uses\r\n  `/apigility/ui`, and the welcome screen uses `/apigility/welcome`. New routes\r\n  for documentation are also available, as detailed above.\r\n\r\n- A new module was created for Apigility-specific interfaces,\r\n  [zf-apigility-provider](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-provider).\r\n  The primary use case is for composition in modules that may or may not be\r\n  consumed by Apigility (e.g., a general-purpose module that could be composed\r\n  into many projects). The only interface currently is\r\n  `ZF\\Apigility\\Provider\\ApigilityProviderInterface`, which replaces\r\n  `Zend\\Apigility\\ApigilityModuleInterface` (and thus prevents the necessity of\r\n  installing all Apigility modules just to implement the interface!).\r\n\r\n- A new module was introduced for handling development mode, \r\n  [zf-development-mode](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-development-mode);\r\n  this is a fork of [NFDevelopmentMode](https://github.com/19ft/NFDevelopmentMode),\r\n  which was based off the equivalent functionality in zf-apigility-skeleton's\r\n  `Application` module. We removed the functionality from the skeleton, and\r\n  added a dependency on the new module.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility-skeleton's layout was updated to match that of the admin UI.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility-admin received numerous updates:\r\n    - Ability to add documentation of services, fields, and operations.\r\n\r\n    - Ability to use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) when configuring an\r\n      OAuth2 authentication adapter.\r\n\r\n    - Ability to inspect, add, configure, and delete zf-content-negotiation\r\n      selectors.\r\n\r\n    - Links to HTML documentation of APIs managed by the Apigility instance\r\n      (more on this below).\r\n\r\n    - Ability to create and manipulate filter chains for each field in a\r\n      service.\r\n\r\n    - (Limited) detection of whether or not an opcode cache is enabled; if\r\n      detected, a modal dialog will be presented to the end-user detailing how\r\n      to disable it.\r\n\r\n    - Completely overhauled and refactored admin UI application to ease\r\n      maintenance and feature additions. The admin UI now uses\r\n      [Bower](http://bower.io) for managing UI asset dependencies, and\r\n      [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for building the UI distribution. We have\r\n      dropped ng-route for the [angular-ui\r\n      ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router), providing us with\r\n      more flexibility in UI implementation and layout. All services,\r\n      controllers, and directives have been moved into their own files.\r\n\r\n    - Countless UI/UX improvements.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility-welcome has been updated to use the Apigility \"Rocket ElePHPant\"\r\n  logo for the splash screen, and to provide buttons to the HTML and Swagger\r\n  documentation, if the appropriate modules are available.\r\n\r\n- **zf-rest and zf-rpc now each store a `service_name` key in the configuration\r\n  for each service.** While efforts have been made to ensure existing\r\n  configuration still works, we recommend adding this key to each service. The\r\n  value should be the short name representation for the service, usually the\r\n  name you provided when creating the service.\r\n\r\n- **All repositories have been updated to make a clean distinction between the\r\n  terms \"Entity\", \"Collection\", and \"Resource\".** An \"Entity\" is anything\r\n  addressable via a URI containing a unique identifier. A \"Collection\" is any\r\n  URI that returns a set of entities. A \"Resource\" refers to a URI that may\r\n  return collections and/or entities. As such, we have several BC breaks:\r\n\r\n    - The event `renderResource` is now `renderEntity`.\r\n\r\n    - The event `renderCollection.resource` is now `renderCollection.entity`.\r\n\r\n    - `ZF\\Hal\\Resource` was renamed to `ZF\\Hal\\Entity`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource` in the zf-mvc-auth configuration is now `entity`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource_http_methods` in zf-rest is now\r\n      `entity_http_methods`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource_class` in zf-rest is now `entity_class`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource_identifier_name` in zf-rest is now\r\n      `entity_identifier_name`. (This change only affects those who have been\r\n      using latest master, but have not updated since late-January 2014.)\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `identifier_name` in zf-apigility `db-connected` configuration\r\n      is now `entity_identifier_name`;\r\n\r\n- zf-hal now properly differentiates between the identifier used in the route\r\n  definition, and the identifier used for the entity; this allows you to use one\r\n  value on the uri -- e.g., `status_id` -- and another in your entity class --\r\n  e.g., `id`. zf-hal will fallback to the `route_identifier_name` if no\r\n  `entity_identifier_name` is present.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility, when detecting an input filter is present, will pull values from\r\n  the input filter, and not use any other values even if provided in the\r\n  request. This prevents SQL errors due to unknown columns.\r\n\r\n  Additionally, zf-apigility's assets were updated, and a Grunt + Bower\r\n  toolchain provided for keeping them up-to-date.\r\n\r\n- zf-rest, when detecting an input filter is present for the current request,\r\n  will inject it into the `ResourceEvent`, allowing developers to retrieve it\r\n  via `$this->getEvent()->getInputFilter()`. \r\n\r\n  Additionally, support for `patchList` was added to the\r\n  `AbstractResourceListener`.\r\n\r\n- zf-api-problem was updated to match [Problem\r\n  API draft 5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-05).\r\n  This has changed the internal structure and JSON representation of problem\r\n  results. If you were manipulating `ApiProblem` objects directly previously,\r\n  you may need to alter your code.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/128739","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/128739/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/128739/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/0.8.0","id":128739,"tag_name":"0.8.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.8.0","draft":false,"author":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2013-12-20T21:30:20Z","published_at":"2013-12-20T21:52:05Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/51453","id":51453,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.tgz","label":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.tgz","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-compressed-tar","state":"uploaded","size":97823152,"download_count":195,"created_at":"2013-12-20T21:44:20Z","updated_at":"2013-12-20T21:52:05Z"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/51454","id":51454,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.zip","label":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.zip","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":103633178,"download_count":1839,"created_at":"2013-12-20T21:48:43Z","updated_at":"2013-12-20T21:52:05Z"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/tarball/0.8.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/zipball/0.8.0","body":"Adds content validation support.\r\n\r\n- **Ups minimum supported PHP version to 5.4.8**.\r\n- New module, zf-content-validation, which allows associating ZF2 input filters\r\n  with named controller services, as well as creation of named input filters via\r\n  a ZF2 abstract service factory.
